# Skilling Notifications
## Description
This plugin provides visual notifications when no longer actively performing the selected skill.
This can help draw attention to Runelite when your character has finished their skilling interation.

The notification is a (customizable) colored overlay that's drawn under UI elements so that, for example, the bank can still be used when skilling.

Custom notification delays can be configured for each skill.

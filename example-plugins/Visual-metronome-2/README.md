# Visual Metronome ![Total installs](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://i.pluginhub.info/shields/installs/plugin/visual-metronome)
A simple overlay that displays a box on your screen, or displays your true tile that changes color every game tick. 

Used for the same purposes as the regular metronome, timing based activities such as PvM or 3-tick fishing. Helpful for if you don't have sound, are listening to music, or just prefer a visual cue.
